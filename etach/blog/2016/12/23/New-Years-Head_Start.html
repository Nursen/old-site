<p>I figured it be a lot easier to keep a New Years resolution about blogging, reflecting, and sharing, if I actually started the year off with a blog. ;) Neat thing about it - powered by <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> and I can use Markdown to author my posts. It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be.</p>
