Today I read this article which goes into the pros and cons of Atom, Sublime, Vim, and VSCode.

As I'm going through the trial period with sublime to deal with my site development, I'm most curious about Atom, which seems like a more natural choice being free and made by GitHub. Since I'm using Github Pages to host my site the github integration would certainly be an added bonus. Plus did I mention it's free? ;) I'll give it a try when my trial period is up with sublime. My only hesitancy is that it supposedly has some lag to it, but I'm hardly a power user truth be told so it will probably be fine for me.
