So my new years project has been finally getting around to getting my website up and running. At Albert's suggestion, I decided to try out Github Pages and Jekyll, and so far I've found that pretty intuitive. I have a bare-bones website running at nursen.github.io, and I'll move it to my custom domain as soon as I figure out the appropriate type of host record to set up. 

I'm not familiar with ruby or markdown yet, and there is a lot I'm still exploring, but I thought it would be in the spirit of the blog to keep a meta log of the process of building the site and my workflow. [enter link description here](nursen.github.io)

Because I'm unfamiliar with markdown, I'm getting my feet wet using stackedit.io as my markdown editor. I'll be syncing it with my google docs so that I have backups of my posts, and as an added bonus I should be able to publish these posts directly to github, making it easy to save these as drafts on my site or even publish directly. 

Currently I'm in the ideation phase for deciding what I want my site to look like, and figuring out how much javascript I'm going to need to learn for this purpose. 

Some ideas for pages on the site include:

 1.  Brainspace: A place where I will post a collage of pictures and thoughts that reflect my mind in its current state. For example...
![An image of an unborn child reaching out through the uterine incision during a prenatal surgery, probably to treat spina bfida](http://news.vanderbilt.edu/files/babyHandSmall.jpg "Prenatal Surgery")

This is the type of image that's been on my mind most recently. It's such an insipiration to me and an image of what I want my life to look like.

2. My soapbox: A Place for my longer rants about the world.

3. The climbing wall: A place for my travels and adventures in movement like rock climbing, hiking, skiing, dancing, biking, aerial yoga, trapese arts, etc.
4. The kitchen: A place to share what I've been eating and recipes and other dietary movements that have caught my mind, as well as a place to share sites and recipes that I love.

5. The Project Logbook: A place to share progress on my side projects like wearables, small devices, etc. And also work on the site, like this post. 

6. The Cozy corner: Where I place book reccommendation. 

I also want to store things like recent inspirations, and keep most of thee sections rolling so that there are archives of things lower in the stack. 

I have a lot of cute ideas about animations, etc. But I think this may be one of those things where I bite off more than I can chew, and get caught up in my ideas of how awesome I want things to be in the future, then go all depth-first and never get anything done, so I should try to focus on this as an iterative process. I want to get the barebones templates in place so I can think content-first and build the habit as I work on polishing the site as I go. 

Hopefully 2016 will be the year of my BFS triumph. 

Cheers,
Nursen

Oh and I almost forgot...

Merry Christmas!!!
